# A blog to help men in a world where sometimes it is hard to be a man. This is not some toxic red pill bullshit, literally a collection of lessons and advice to help young men find success in life.

# Women are welcome too! Though the advice here is often aimed at men it can be of use to women as well, and hopefully all who read it can become more successful in their lives.

# You will not find tribalism in these pages; more something in the middle, but most definitely nothing from the looney tunes on the right or the people on the far far left, we are aiming for that area in the middle where science and common sense prevails. If you would like to be a part of that then most definitely hit me up and we can discuss collaborations and cross promotion.
